what broke today?
-> the fastapi did not show the intended output like /health in /docs

why did it break?
-> It broke because i defined the same route 2 times , which i am pretty sure i didn't 

how did you fix it?
-> i removed the one of the 2 defined routes and reloaded the API

One concept the finally clicked 
-> i am not sure

One mistake you will not make 
-> never run the code before ensuring it is correct

One thing that still feels fuzzy
-> defining routes and linking them to the main.py

Did you follow your non-negotiable rule today?
-> YES I did not postponed day to tommorrow because I did not feel like it
