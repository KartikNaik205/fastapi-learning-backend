what broke initially?
-> Nothing broke but i did forget about creating the virtual environment before testing the backend API which led to my code using the global library and stuff

how did i fix it?
-> i created a virtual environment using python -m venv venv and activated using venv\Scripts\activate in the terminal and installed the fastapi uvicorn libraray

what did i clearly understand today
-> I learnt that creating a virtual environment is very crucial and also creating a repo, adding my code and commiting to it

what is still confusing?
-> how commands work and if the git repo gets created automatically how do i connect it and the pycache stuff
