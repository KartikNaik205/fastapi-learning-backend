what new behaviour did you add to the API today?
-> i didnt really get it but i think made the API give me a status report

one concrete thing swagger showed you
-> it showed me the status and the varibles datatypes

one mistake 
-> i did not import the status library

one concept that became clearer
-> how start vene and the server from the terminal without asking chatgpt

One thing you still don't fullt trust yet
-> my understanding on API

did you respect your daily minimum
no , i was too late
